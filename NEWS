#       Release 1.13 (stable) [2016-07-08]                                     #
#******************************************************************************#

ADT's functions may change container elements or manipulate with built in
iterators. This can result to data inconsistency among different threads.
To solve this possible issue, a programmer have to separate read and write
operations to containers. Write operation can not be invoked in the same time
with other write or read operations, and should get exclusive access to
the container. Read operations can be processed simultaneously with each other,
but not with write operation (because of possible dirty reads).

Access predicates solve these problems and support lock methods for exclusive
writes and concurrent reads from different threads. Lock functions return
TRUE state only when you get appropriate access to the container. They support
wait and no wait behaviors. If wait flag is set, then lock functions wait until
the lock is taken. In no wait mode they try to get lock for some short period
of time (spinlock cycle). And if no success, then return FALSE. Your code may
check the return status and do something else instead of just waiting.

Also in this release:
    * Was added prefetch code to MultiTree and UniqueTree, which improved binary
      search algorithms in these containers.
    * Added non linear filters to Filter library, which do Min, Max and Median
      filtering of integer and floating-point arrays.
    * MinMeap and MaxHeap were refactored to have correct cache friendly
      alignment of internal data.

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 1.12 (stable) [2016-04-16]                                     #
#******************************************************************************#

To provide multithreaded highly concurrent read only access to elements of ADT
containers were developed external iterators. They allow to walk through
the elements in very fast and efficient way. You can not change data, using
this iterator, but can do non blocking multithreaded access for reading,
searching and counting elements. In opposite to forward and backward iterators
the external iterator lost its actual position when you change ADT structure
(insert, remove set or overwrite its elements). In such case you should
each time to reassign external iterator before doing sequence of read only
operations.

Minor changes:
    * Array library: Added functions GetBit, SetBit, ResetBit, InvertBit,
      FindSetBitFwd, FindResetBitFwd, FindSetBitBwd, FindResetBitBwd, CountBits
    * Complex library: Improved functions to operate with complex numbers
    * Matrix library: Added functions to operate with complex number matrices

#******************************************************************************#

Finally stable release after ten month of debugging, optimization and writing
new libraries. In this release I am glad to present you new modules, which
significantly extend LinAsm applications. They implement abstract data types
such as Stack, Deque, Min/Max heaps and very powerful tree structure - in-memory
b-trees. Also were added new libraries: Object pool and Accumulating buffer
to optimize memory management routines. For detailed descriptions of the new
modules, fixed bugs and new features see documentation and ChangeLog file inside
the release archive.

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.99 (beta) [2013-02-04]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

It is time to global optimization. For this release I completely rewrote modules
"Array", "Statistics" and "String". Plus I made some brief improvement in
Math library. In previous version of LinAsm release the modules "Statistics"
and "String" were working too slow. String library even was not optimized.
Now all this is fixed and work much faster (here is the test of statistics
library). Many of new functions were added to Array and String modules.
Some functions have changed prototypes + few bugs were fixed. Details can be
found in "ChangeLog" file inside the package archive.

Major changes in this version:
    * String library is completely rewrote with vector instructions. Now it is
      very fast.
    * Were added integer arithmetic functions to Array library.
    * Added robust statistics functions "LowerQuartile", "UpperQuartile"
      and "InterquartileRange" for integer types.
    * Improved rounding functions in Math library.
    * Array library has new functions to merge sorted arrays, collect
      unique values and compute count of duplicates.
    * String module now can manage array of strings. Were implemented searching
      and sorting operations. Added check for duplicate strings.
    * Changed prototypes for key sorting functions in Array library. Removed
      binary searching functions for complex keys.
    * Were fixed incorrect loop counter in Statistics library for functions
      "Variance", "StandardDeviation", and "AbsoluteDeviation".

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.98 (beta) [2012-10-25]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

After two months of hard working on a new release, I finally have finished
a lot of functions (but not all of them) which have to be in final library.
In this release I improved many functions from Math library, which were working
too slow in previous version, and added much faster mathematical routines
for engineering calculations.

Almost all of them use vector instructions and work 2 times faster then
their analogs from GNU C library. A performance test will be added later in
release 0.99, when Math library is complete.

Also in new release were:
    * added functions "Move", "Clone" and rounding routines in Array library
    * added functions "Exp2", "Exp2m1", "Exp10", "Exp10m1", "Exp", "Expm1" for
      real argument and improved "Exp2", "Exp10", "Exp" for integral argument
    * improved "Scale2", "Scale10" and "ScaleE" functions
    * added trigonometric functions "SinQ", "CosQ", "TanQ", "CotQ", "SinCosQ",
      "Cath" and improved "Hypot" function
    * added "GCD" and "LCM" functions
    * added fast "RoundInt" and "Truncate" functions
    * fixed error in Math library (see ChangeLog for details)
    * added string concatenation functions and "ReplaceSymbol" function in
      String library

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.97 (beta) [2012-08-27]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

This release extends libraries usage for non C++ projects and provide C
prototypes for all functions and data structures. The C functions have the
same behavior and parameters, like original C++ functions, and work in the
same ways like their originals. The assembly language code stays the same for
both variants, and it is shared between them, just providing aliases for already
implemented functions.

Also in release 0.97 were:
    * fixed non critical bug in Array library
    * changed function names in String library
    * modified parameters passing method for Numbers library

For more details about release changes see the ChangeLog file inside the LinAsm
package v0.97.

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.96 (beta) [2012-08-23]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

As I promised before in my future plans for the project, I added Digital Signals
Processing (DSP) functions to the library package. They implement FIR filters
and window functions for future Spectral analysis module. Now LinAsm release
has the two additional libraries:
    * Filter - Finite impulse response digital filters
    * Window - Window functions for digital signal processing

And from now the project has a beta version label. So it is almost done, and
can be used in your software development projects.

#******************************************************************************#
#       First release 0.95 (alpha) [2012-08-15]                                #
#******************************************************************************#

At last, I have finished all preparation for the first release of LinAsm
project. I made code checks and wrote good documentation (as I think) for
libraries functions. But you should remember that this is first public release
of the project. And it is early alpha version. So it may have some bugs
and mistakes in the source code. If you find some, please send them
to the bug tracker.

This release includes following libraries:
    * Angle - Angles conversion from different units
    * Array - Common routines that are useful for arrays
    * Math - Math routines
    * Numbers - Numbers conversion functions
    * Sequence - Subsequence searching algorithms
    * Statistics - Widely used statistical functions
    * String - Safe string functions
    * Time - Time functions
