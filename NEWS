#******************************************************************************#

LinAsm library is converted into shared object file (*.so) instead of static lib
file (*.a). Also was fixed compilation bag in MAP macro and added new functions
into Math block.

Here is the list of changed were made:
    * Array library: Fixed compilation error in MAP macro.
    * Math.asm library: Added functions Cancel, AbsError, RelError, SinH, CosH,
      TanH, ArcSinH, ArcCosH, ArcTanH.
    * Math.asm library: Improved functions Exp2, Exp2m1, Exp10, Exp10m1, Exp,
      Expm1 and trigonometric functions.

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 1.03 (stable) [2014-08-03]                                     #
#******************************************************************************#

This release adds new math functions which were not developed until now,
such as inverse trigonometric and logarithmic functions. Also were rewrote
exponentiation functions and trigonometric functions too.

The detailed list of new functions is here:
    * Math library: Were added functions: Sin, Cos, Tan, SinCos. All of them
      do range reductions for all available angle values supported by
      floating-point format.
    * Math library: Inverse trigonometric functions: ArcSin, ArcCos, ArcTan
      compute inverse sine, cosine and tangent values.
    * Math library: New logarithmic functions compute logarithm values to base
      2, 10, e (natural logarithm base) and to custom base.
    * Math library: Functions ExpB and ExpBm1 can compute "base" raised to "exp"
      power, where "base" and "exp" are floating-point numbers. Base should be
      positive number or zero.
    * Array library: Were added functions Sign (replace value with its sign,
      using three-state comparison comparison), SumSqrDiff, SumAbsDiff.
    * Statistics library: Were released Fechner and Spearman correlation,
      fast and efficient for big data series.

#       Release 1.02 (stable) [2014-05-02]                                     #
#******************************************************************************#

New extends abstract data type library with new class called "Vector", which
provides the same functionality as STL vector class, but works faster. Also were
redesigned "Array" library. Were added object array functions such as object
searching, sorting, counting, extracting unique objects and so on. String
library also was recreated to works with array of strings. Were added
bidirectional search for symbol, symbols set, and substrings.

Minor changed in this release:
    * Added function IsInit in all ADT classes.
    * Improved data conversion functions in the "Array" library.
    * Added functions FindSequenceFwd and FindSequenceBwd in MultiTree and
      MultiHash abstract data types.

      MultiHash and UniqueHash ADTs.
    * Added functions FindSymbolFwd, FindSymbolBwd, FindSymbolsFwd,
      FindSymbolsBwd, FindSubStringFwd, FindSubStringBwd in the "String" library.
    * Added functions: InsertHead, InsertTail, ExtractHead, ExtractTail in
      Deque ADT.
    * Added functions Insert, Extract in Stack ADT.
    * Added index rearrangement call back function in Heap ADT, which allow
      to trace objects when heap swap elements to correct their order during
      Insert and Extract operations.

#       Release 1.00 (stable) [2013-12-16]                                     #
#******************************************************************************#

Finally stable release after ten month of debugging, optimization and writing
new libraries. In this release I am glad to present you new modules, which
significantly extend LinAsm applications. They implement abstract data types
such as Stack, Deque, Min/Max heaps and very powerful tree structure - in-memory
b-trees. Also were added new libraries: Object pool and Accumulating buffer
to optimize memory management routines. For detailed descriptions of the new
modules, fixed bugs and new features see documentation and ChangeLog file inside
the release archive.

Here is brief description of new modules in the LinAsm project:
    * Accumulator.h - Accumulating buffer library
    * Pool.h - Object pool library
    * FPU.h - FPU control functions library
    * SIMD.h - SIMD control functions library
    * Stack.h - Stack ADT
    * Deque.h - Double-ended queue ADT
    * MaxHeap.h - Binary max heap ADT

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.99 (beta) [2013-02-04]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

It is time to global optimization. For this release I completely rewrote modules
"Array", "Statistics" and "String". Plus I made some brief improvement in
Math library. In previous version of LinAsm release the modules "Statistics"
and "String" were working too slow. String library even was not optimized.
Now all this is fixed and work much faster (here is the test of statistics
library). Many of new functions were added to Array and String modules.
Some functions have changed prototypes + few bugs were fixed. Details can be
found in "ChangeLog" file inside the package archive.

Major changes in this version:
    * String library is completely rewrote with vector instructions. Now it is
      very fast.
    * Were added integer arithmetic functions to Array library.
    * Added robust statistics functions "LowerQuartile", "UpperQuartile"
      and "InterquartileRange" for integer types.
    * Improved rounding functions in Math library.
    * Array library has new functions to merge sorted arrays, collect
      unique values and compute count of duplicates.
    * String module now can manage array of strings. Were implemented searching
      and sorting operations. Added check for duplicate strings.
    * Changed prototypes for key sorting functions in Array library. Removed
      binary searching functions for complex keys.
    * Were fixed incorrect loop counter in Statistics library for functions
      "Variance", "StandardDeviation", and "AbsoluteDeviation".

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.98 (beta) [2012-10-25]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

After two months of hard working on a new release, I finally have finished
a lot of functions (but not all of them) which have to be in final library.
In this release I improved many functions from Math library, which were working
too slow in previous version, and added much faster mathematical routines
for engineering calculations.

Almost all of them use vector instructions and work 2 times faster then
their analogs from GNU C library. A performance test will be added later in
release 0.99, when Math library is complete.

Also in new release were:
    * added functions "Move", "Clone" and rounding routines in Array library
    * added functions "Exp2", "Exp2m1", "Exp10", "Exp10m1", "Exp", "Expm1" for
      real argument and improved "Exp2", "Exp10", "Exp" for integral argument
    * improved "Scale2", "Scale10" and "ScaleE" functions
    * added trigonometric functions "SinQ", "CosQ", "TanQ", "CotQ", "SinCosQ",
      "Cath" and improved "Hypot" function
    * added "GCD" and "LCM" functions
    * added fast "RoundInt" and "Truncate" functions
    * fixed error in Math library (see ChangeLog for details)
    * added string concatenation functions and "ReplaceSymbol" function in
      String library

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.97 (beta) [2012-08-27]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

This release extends libraries usage for non C++ projects and provide C
prototypes for all functions and data structures. The C functions have the
same behavior and parameters, like original C++ functions, and work in the
same ways like their originals. The assembly language code stays the same for
both variants, and it is shared between them, just providing aliases for already
implemented functions.

Also in release 0.97 were:
    * fixed non critical bug in Array library
    * changed function names in String library
    * modified parameters passing method for Numbers library

For more details about release changes see the ChangeLog file inside the LinAsm
package v0.97.

#******************************************************************************#
#       Release 0.96 (beta) [2012-08-23]                                       #
#******************************************************************************#

As I promised before in my future plans for the project, I added Digital Signals
Processing (DSP) functions to the library package. They implement FIR filters
and window functions for future Spectral analysis module. Now LinAsm release
has the two additional libraries:
    * Filter - Finite impulse response digital filters
    * Window - Window functions for digital signal processing

And from now the project has a beta version label. So it is almost done, and
can be used in your software development projects.

#******************************************************************************#
#       First release 0.95 (alpha) [2012-08-15]                                #
#******************************************************************************#

At last, I have finished all preparation for the first release of LinAsm
project. I made code checks and wrote good documentation (as I think) for
libraries functions. But you should remember that this is first public release
of the project. And it is early alpha version. So it may have some bugs
and mistakes in the source code. If you find some, please send them
to the bug tracker.

This release includes following libraries:
    * Angle - Angles conversion from different units
    * Array - Common routines that are useful for arrays
    * Math - Math routines
    * Numbers - Numbers conversion functions
    * Sequence - Subsequence searching algorithms
    * Statistics - Widely used statistical functions
    * String - Safe string functions
    * Time - Time functions
