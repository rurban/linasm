INTRODUCTION
============

    Linux assembly libraries project called "LinAsm" is the collection of fast
    libraries,‭ ‬which‭ ‬are written in pure assembly language for x86-64‭ ‬Linux OS.

    It implements many common and widely used algorithms, mostly developed
    for acceleration of data analysis and time series processing. Later they
    were extended with more mathematical and general algorithms that are used
    inside C and C++ programs and make them very fast on that platform.

    To get more information about this software, please visit the official
    web site: http://linasm.sourceforge.net

LICENSING
=========

    LinAsm is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
    Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
    version 3 of the License (or any later version).

    For more information, see the file COPYING.

PACKAGE STRUCTURE
=================

    The source codes of the libraries are placed into separate directories
    called "include" and "source".

    The "include" directory holds C and C++ header files that define functions
    prototypes, structures and data types. They should be copied as is into your
    local include directory such as /usr/include or /usr/local/include.
    Installation procedure will do it for you automatically, according to the
    settings you provide.

    The "source" directory includes assembly source code, which is written on
    Flat Assembler programming language, developed by Tomasz Grysztar. Its
    official web site is http://flatassembler.net

    The source code should be compiled by "fasm" executable file, which
    is placed into "build" directory of LinAsm release. To allow this file
    to be launched, please check that a file system has the mount option "exec"
    and the file "build/fasm" has appropriate execution permission.

INSTALLATION
============

    Libraries compilation and installation process is fully described
    in "INSTALL" file. Please revise the appropriate document for details.
