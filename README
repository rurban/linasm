INTRODUCTION
============

	Linux assembler libraries project called "LinAsm" is the collection of
	very fast and optimized assembler wrote libraries for x86-64 Linux.

	It implements many common and widely used algorithms, mostly developed
	for acceleration of data analysis and time series processing. Later they
	were extended with more mathematical and general algorithms that are used
	inside C++ programs and make them very fast on that platform.

	To get more information about this software, please visit the official
	website: http://linasm.sourceforge.net

LICENSING
=========

	LinAsm is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
	Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
	version 3 of the License (or any later version).

	For more information, see the file COPYING.

PACKAGE STRUCTURE
=================

	The source code of the libraries is placed into separate directories called
	"include" and "source".

	The "include" directory holds C++ header files that define functions
	prototypes, structures and data types. They should be copied as is into
	your local include directory such as /usr/include or /usr/local/include.
	Installation procedure will do it for you automatically, according to
	the settings you provide.

	The "source" directory includes assembler source code, which is written on
	Flat Assembler programming language, developed by Tomasz Grysztar.
	Its official web site is http://flatassembler.net

	The source code should be compiled by "fasm" executable file,
	which is placed into "build" directory of release. To allow this file
	to be launched, please check that a file system has mount option "exec"
	and the file "build/fasm" has appropriate execution permission.

INSTALLATION
============

	Libraries compilation and installation process is fully described
	in "INSTALL" file. Please revise the appropriate document for details.
